        <h1>Shark HyperAir</h1>
        <p>Shark is a home appliance and beauty product company. I specifically targeted and redesigned their Hyperair hair dryer 
            product page. My goal with this project was to follow a strict grid and build out a design system that could 
            theoretically be applied to other pages. I then took my design and coded it top to bottom using HTML and CSS
