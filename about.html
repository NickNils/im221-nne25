        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My name is Nicholas Evangelinos. I’m a graphic designer and UiUx designer from Queens, New York. I study graphic design 
            with a minor in digital media at Drexel University. I remember the first day my mom took me to an art class, and I found 
            out the class was two hours long. To my impatient eight year old brain that seemed like an eternity, but by the time 
            the class was over I was in love with creating. That same passion for creating seeps into my design work. I approach every 
            design problem as an opportunity to create something new and exciting that hasn’t been done before. My philosophy when 
            designing is to push my designs as far as possible, and if they are too out there I can always edit back. If I never try a 
            crazy idea I’ll never know if it could have been great. When I’m not designing I love painting, watching movies, and rock 
            climbing. My favorite movie right now is “Nope” by Jordan Peele. I also love listening to music. I have a soundtrack to 
            everything I do in my life.
