        <h1>Booking.com</h1>
        <p>Booking.com is a travel booking website. I created designs for various pages that take us through the user 
            task of finding and booking a stay. Throughout the pages there is a common motif in the layout out being 
            the column of space towards the left side of the screen. The space is used differently on different pages. 
            This creates an experience unique to booking.com.
