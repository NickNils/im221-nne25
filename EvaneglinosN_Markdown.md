# About:
My name is Nicholas Evangelinos. I’m a graphic designer and UiUx designer from Queens, New York. I study graphic design with a minor in digital media at Drexel University.

I remember the first day my mom took me to an art class, and I found out the class was two hours long. To my impatient eight year old brain that seemed like an eternity, but by the time the class was over I was in love with creating. That same passion for creating seeps into my design work. I approach every design problem as an opportunity to create something new and exciting that hasn’t been done before. My philosophy when designing is to push my designs as far as possible, and if they are too out there I can always edit back. If I never try a crazy idea I’ll never know if it could have been great.

When I’m not designing I love painting, watching movies, and rock climbing. My favorite movie right now is “Nope” by Jordan Peele. I also love listening to music. I have a soundtrack to everything I do in my life.

# Absurd Cases App Design:
## 2023
Absurd Cases is a phone case customization app adapted from Casetify. It allows its users to customize a phone case for any iPhone model. Users can add photos from their phone to the back of the case, adjust the color, and the level of protection the case provides.
## Target Audience:
Stevie is a 19 year old college student studying graphic design. She has a low income, so she spends her money carefully on quality products. She's looking for a way to express herself artistically and show off the graphics she creates. 
Needs to:
- Express herself creatively
- Protect her phone from anything
## Old Design:
Casetify, for being such a creative brand that frequently works with artists, has a very bland app.
The dull color pallet does not suit the brand.
A big issue with the current app is how long it takes to get the user to the main customization screen where they get to change the look of the phone case. This is the main task the user wants to complete. They don’t want to go through screen after screen of setup to get there.
## New Design:
I wanted to simplify the steps it takes to start customizing and make the user feel rewarded for using the app immediately. My solution for this problem was to assume some settings for the user as a default phone case. This way they get to the main customization screen after only one click instead of the five it takes on the Casetify app. An interesting design challenge was fitting all the customization options into one screen without making it feel overwhelming and cluttered.
## Branding:
The branding for Absurd Cases is a brutalist style centered around bold primary colors and flat geometric shapes. The typography is very bold and geometric. The idea is that these simple shapes and colors are the building blocks for creativity. The interface is engaging and welcoming.
## Micro Interactions:
I animated the generic phone icon to transform into the logo referencing how the users will transform their generic phones into something unique
This inactivity animation will play on a loop every 20 or so seconds as a fun way to remind the user that their on the app
This tap animation adds a little fun moment to an otherwise uninteresting interaction

# Tileworks Branding:
## 2023
Tileworks is a museum located in Doylestown Pennsylvania. It was originally founded as a pottery workshop in 1898, and tiles are still produced there today similarly to how they were made in 1898. I created a pictorial, typographical, and abstract logo as a brand identity redesign. I also created mockups for some of the extended branding and packaging.

# Booking.com Website design:
## 2023
Booking.com is a travel booking website. I created designs for various pages that take us through the user task of finding and booking a stay. Throughout the pages there is a common motif in the layout out being the column of space towards the left side of the screen. The space is used differently on different pages. This creates an experience unique to booking.com.

# Aesop’s Fables Brochure:
## 2023
- The Lion, The Wolf, and the Fox is a story about deception, violence, and betrayal. I wanted to depict this story in a more immersive way through a brochure. I focused on expressing different emotions and events of the story through typography. An important element of the story is the deception of the fox character, so I represented this by not giving the reader all the information at once, slowly revealing the phrase “struck him dead’ as they unfold the story. I also connected elements from the inside of the brochure to elements from the outside, causing the design to change as the viewer unfolds it depending on the context

# Shark website design:
## 2023
- Shark is a home appliance and beauty product company. I specifically targeted and redesigned their Hyperair hair dryer product page. My goal with this project was to follow a strict grid and build out a design system that could theoretically be applied to other pages. I then took my design and coded it top to bottom using HTML and CSS.

# Smooth Goo Publication:
## 2023
- Smooth Goo is an experimental music magazine, releasing on an irregular schedule as it’s produced. The magazine focuses on interviewing smaller underground artists. The magazine’s brand is left field surrealist and unconventional. For this issue I used a blob motif throughout the magazine for its cover article. 
- ## Masthead:
- The masthead of the publication is based on 60s psychedelic rock posters, and is designed to be an actual sticker that patrons of the magazine could collect as they buy more issues. It’s not afraid to be slightly illegible or out of the norm for a magazine logo because the goal of Smooth Goo is to develop a niche dedicated fan base, not appeal to a wide audience.
- ## Imagemaking:
- For this issue of the magazine I developed a system using these ambiguous blob shapes as fake cutouts in the magazine. A fun design challenge I had was figuring out different ways to use the blobs. In addition to the organic blob shapes the magazine uses a variety of image making including illustration, photography, and bold typography.
