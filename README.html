<h1 id="about:">About:</h1>

<p>My name is Nicholas Evangelinos. I’m a graphic designer and UiUx designer from Queens, New York. I study graphic design with a minor in digital media at Drexel University.
I remember the first day my mom took me to an art class, and I found out the class was two hours long. To my impatient eight year old brain that seemed like an eternity, but by the time the class was over I was in love with creating. That same passion for creating seeps into my design work. I approach every design problem as an opportunity to create something new and exciting that hasn’t been done before. My philosophy when designing is to push my designs as far as possible, and if they are too out there I can always edit back. If I never try a crazy idea I’ll never know if it could have been great.
When I’m not designing I love painting, watching movies, and rock climbing. My favorite movie right now is “Nope” by Jordan Peele. I also love listening to music. I have a soundtrack to everything I do in my life.</p>
