        <h1>The Lion the Wolf and the Fox</h1>
        <p>The Lion, The Wolf, and the Fox is a story about deception, violence, and betrayal. I wanted to depict 
            this story in a more immersive way through a brochure. I focused on expressing different emotions 
            and events of the story through typography. An important element of the story is the deception of the 
            fox character, so I represented this by not giving the reader all the information at once, slowly 
            revealing the phrase “struck him dead’ as they unfold the story. I also connected elements from the 
            inside of the brochure to elements from the outside, causing the design to change as the viewer 
            unfolds it depending on the context.
