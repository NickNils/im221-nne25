        <p>Tileworks is a museum located in Doylestown Pennsylvania. It was originally founded as a pottery workshop in 1898, 
            and tiles are still produced there today similarly to how they were made in 1898. I created a pictorial, 
            typographical, and abstract logo as a brand identity redesign. I also created mockups for some of the extended 
            branding and packaging.
